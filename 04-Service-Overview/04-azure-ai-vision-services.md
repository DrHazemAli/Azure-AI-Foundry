## Getting Started

### Basic Setup

```python
from azure.ai.vision.imageanalysis import ImageAnalysisClient
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential

# Initialize the client
vision_client = ImageAnalysisClient(
    endpoint=endpoint,
    credential=AzureKeyCredential(key)
)

# Analyze an image
with open("sample-image.jpg", "rb") as image_data:
    result = vision_client.analyze(
        image_data=image_data,
        visual_features=["Caption", "Tags", "Objects"]
    )

print(f"Caption: {result.caption.text}")
print(f"Tags: {[tag.name for tag in result.tags.list]}")
```

### OCR Text Extraction

```python
from azure.ai.vision.imageanalysis import ImageAnalysisClient

# Extract text from image
with open("document.jpg", "rb") as image_data:
    result = vision_client.analyze(
        image_data=image_data,
        visual_features=["Read"]
    )

# Print extracted text
for page in result.read.pages:
    for line in page.lines:
        print(line.text)
```

## Integration with Azure AI Foundry

```python
from azure.ai.projects import AIProjectClient

# Initialize project client
project_client = AIProjectClient(
    endpoint="your_project_endpoint",
    credential=DefaultAzureCredential()
)

# Create a vision-enabled agent
agent = project_client.agents.create_agent(
    model="gpt-4o",
    name="Vision-Enabled Agent",
    instructions="You can analyze images and extract information from visual content.",
    tools=[
        {
            "type": "function",
            "function": {
                "name": "analyze_image",
                "description": "Analyze image content and extract insights"
            }
        }
    ]
)
```

## Common Use Cases

### Retail and E-commerce
- Product image analysis and categorization
- Visual search capabilities
- Inventory management through image recognition
- Quality control and defect detection

### Healthcare
- Medical image analysis
- Patient identification and verification
- Document processing for medical records
- Accessibility features for visually impaired users

### Manufacturing

- Document digitization
- Compliance document analysis

## Best Practices

1. **Image Quality Optimization**
   - Use high-resolution images when possible
   - Ensure proper lighting and contrast
   - Minimize noise and artifacts

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement caching for frequently analyzed images
   - Use batch processing for multiple images
   - Optimize image sizes for API limits

3. **Security and Privacy**
   - Implement proper access controls
   - Handle sensitive visual data appropriately
   - Follow data retention policies

## Custom Vision Models

### Training Custom Models

```python
from azure.cognitiveservices.vision.customvision.training import CustomVisionTrainingClient
from azure.cognitiveservices.vision.customvision.prediction import CustomVisionPredictionClient

# Create training client
trainer = CustomVisionTrainingClient(training_key, endpoint)

# Create a new project
project = trainer.create_project("Product Classification")

# Add tags
apple_tag = trainer.create_tag(project.id, "Apple")
banana_tag = trainer.create_tag(project.id, "Banana")

# Add images and train model
# ... training process ...

# Make predictions
predictor = CustomVisionPredictionClient(prediction_key, endpoint)
```
