- Semantic analysis and clustering
- Content similarity matching
- Automated tagging and categorization

### Visual Content Understanding
- Image content analysis
- Visual similarity detection
- Object and scene recognition
- Brand and logo detection

### Multi-modal Content Processing
- Combined text and image analysis
- Cross-modal content matching
- Unified content representation
- Holistic content understanding

## Getting Started

### Basic Setup

```python
from azure.ai.textanalytics import TextAnalyticsClient
from azure.ai.vision.imageanalysis import ImageAnalysisClient
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential

# Initialize clients
text_client = TextAnalyticsClient(
    endpoint=text_endpoint,
    credential=AzureKeyCredential(text_key)
)

vision_client = ImageAnalysisClient(
    endpoint=vision_endpoint,
    credential=AzureKeyCredential(vision_key)
)

# Analyze content
def analyze_content(text_content, image_path=None):
    results = {}
    
    # Text analysis
    if text_content:
        sentiment = text_client.analyze_sentiment([text_content])[0]
        key_phrases = text_client.extract_key_phrases([text_content])[0]
        entities = text_client.recognize_entities([text_content])[0]
        
        results['text_analysis'] = {
            'sentiment': sentiment.sentiment,
            'key_phrases': key_phrases.key_phrases,
            'entities': [entity.text for entity in entities.entities]
        }
    
    # Image analysis
    if image_path:
        with open(image_path, "rb") as image_data:
            vision_result = vision_client.analyze(
                image_data=image_data,
                visual_features=["Caption", "Tags", "Objects", "Brands"]
            )
        
        results['image_analysis'] = {
            'caption': vision_result.caption.text if vision_result.caption else "",
            'tags': [tag.name for tag in vision_result.tags.list] if vision_result.tags else [],
            'objects': [obj.object_property for obj in vision_result.objects.list] if vision_result.objects else []
        }
    
    return results
```

## Integration with Azure AI Foundry

```python
from azure.ai.projects import AIProjectClient

# Create content understanding agent
project_client = AIProjectClient(
    endpoint="your_project_endpoint",
    credential=DefaultAzureCredential()
)

agent = project_client.agents.create_agent(
    model="gpt-4o",
    name="Content Understanding Agent",
    instructions="You can analyze and understand various types of content including text, images, and multimedia.",
    tools=[
        {
            "type": "function",
            "function": {
                "name": "analyze_content",
                "description": "Analyze content and extract insights across multiple modalities"
            }
        }
    ]
)
```
