instructions: |
  You are a helpful customer support agent. Always be polite 
  and provide accurate information based on the knowledge base.
```

#### 2. Using the SDK
```python
from azure.ai.foundry import AgentService

# Initialize agent service
agent_service = AgentService(endpoint="your-endpoint", key="your-key")

# Create agent
agent = agent_service.create_agent(
    name="Customer Support Agent",
    model="gpt-4",
    instructions="You are a helpful customer support agent...",
    tools=["function_calling", "bing_search"]
)
```

- Enhanced monitoring and control

### Implementation Example

```python
# Multi-agent system setup
primary_agent = agent_service.create_agent(
    name="Workflow Orchestrator",
    model="gpt-4",
    tools=["agent_communication"]
)

analysis_agent = agent_service.create_agent(
    name="Data Analyst",
    model="gpt-4",
    tools=["data_analysis", "visualization"]
)

# Connect agents
primary_agent.add_connected_agent(analysis_agent)
```
