## Model Catalog Overview

### What is Azure AI Foundry Models?

Azure AI Foundry Models offers:

- **Rich catalog** of cutting-edge models from Microsoft, OpenAI, DeepSeek, Hugging Face, Meta, and more
- **Side-by-side comparison** and evaluation tools
- **Built-in deployment** with confidence using fine-tuning, observability, and responsible AI tools
- **Flexible integration** - bring your own model, use hosted models, or integrate with Azure services
- **Enterprise security** and compliance built-in

### Model Categories

The catalog is organized into two main categories:

#### 1. Models Sold Directly by Azure

These models are hosted and sold by Microsoft under Microsoft Product Terms:

**Characteristics:**
- Official first-party support from Microsoft
- High level of integration with Azure services
- Extensive performance benchmarking and validation
- Adherence to Microsoft's Responsible AI standards
- Enterprise-grade scalability, reliability, and security
- Fungible Provisioned Throughput across models

**Examples:**
- Azure OpenAI models (GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, Claude, etc.)
- DeepSeek models
- xAI models

#### 2. Models from Partners and Community

The majority of models in the catalog, provided by trusted third-party organizations:

**Characteristics:**
- Developed and supported by external partners
- Diverse range of specialized models
- Community-driven innovation
- Standard Azure AI integration
- Support managed by respective providers

**Examples:**
- Hugging Face models
- Meta models (Llama family)
- Cohere models
- Stability AI models
- NVIDIA models

## Model Collections

The catalog organizes models into specific collections:

#### Azure OpenAI Models
- Flagship Azure OpenAI models with exclusive Azure integration
- Full Microsoft support and SLA coverage
- Seamless integration with Foundry Agent Service

#### Open Models from Hugging Face Hub
- Hundreds of models for real-time inference
- Managed compute deployment options
- Community-maintained with Hugging Face support

## Deployment Options

### Standard Deployment

**Overview:**
Standard deployment provides API-based access to models hosted in Microsoft-managed infrastructure.

**Characteristics:**
- Pay-per-token billing model
- No infrastructure management required
- Instant scalability
- Built-in content safety features
- Global availability

**Use Cases:**
- Prototyping and development

### Managed Compute

**Overview:**
Deploy models to dedicated Azure virtual machines with full control over the infrastructure.

**Characteristics:**
- Dedicated virtual machine resources
- Customizable compute configurations
- Enhanced security and isolation
- Support for custom models
- Full administrative control

**Use Cases:**
- Production workloads with consistent traffic
- Custom model deployments
- Strict security requirements
- Performance optimization needs

## Best Practices

### Model Selection

1. **Define Requirements**
   - Identify use case and performance needs
   - Determine cost constraints
   - Assess compliance requirements

2. **Evaluate Options**
   - Compare model capabilities
   - Test with sample data
   - Benchmark performance metrics

### Deployment Strategy

1. **Start with Standard**
   - Use Standard deployment for initial development
   - Evaluate performance and costs
   - Scale based on usage patterns

2. **Optimize for Production**
   - Consider Managed Compute for consistent workloads
   - Implement proper monitoring
   - Plan capacity management
