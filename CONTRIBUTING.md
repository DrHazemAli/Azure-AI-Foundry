   - Use descriptive titles
   - Provide clear descriptions
   - Include reproduction steps for bugs
   - Tag appropriately (bug, enhancement, documentation, etc.)

### 2. Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch** from the main branch
2. **Make your changes** following the guidelines above
3. **Test your changes** thoroughly
4. **Update documentation** if needed
5. **Commit your changes** with clear messages

### 3. Commit Message Guidelines
