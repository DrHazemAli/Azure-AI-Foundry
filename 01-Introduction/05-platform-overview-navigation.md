#### 2. **Left Navigation Pane**
The left pane is organized around three distinct stages of AI development:

**Define and Explore**
- Project goals definition
- Model and service exploration
- Testing against use cases
- Model selection and evaluation

**Build and Customize**
- Active solution building
- Model fine-tuning and customization
- Data grounding and integration
- Application development

**Observe and Improve**
- Performance monitoring
- Application debugging with tracing
- Evaluation comparisons
- Safety and security integration

#### 3. **Management Center**
Centralized location for governance and management:
- Projects and resources management
- Quotas and usage metrics
- Access and permissions control
- Team collaboration settings

## Project Types and Navigation

### Foundry Projects vs Hub-Based Projects

The navigation experience differs slightly based on your project type:

#### **Foundry Projects**
- Display **(AI Foundry)** in breadcrumb navigation

- Streamlined project management

#### **Hub-Based Projects**
- Display **(Hub)** in breadcrumb navigation
- Extended navigation with Azure ML integration
- Advanced MLOps capabilities
- Enterprise governance features

### Identifying Your Project Type

**From Breadcrumb Navigation:**
- Second line shows either **(AI Foundry)** or **(Hub)**

**From All Resources Page:**
- Parent resource displays as **(AI Foundry)** or **(Hub)**

## Key Navigation Areas

- Hidden items remain accessible via the **...More** menu

#### **Per-Project Customization**
- Each project has its own navigation settings
- Customizations don't affect other projects
- User-specific settings (not shared across team members)

#### **Best Practices for Navigation Setup**
- Pin items based on your primary workflow
- Keep frequently accessed tools visible
- Group related functionality together
- Review and adjust settings periodically

## Advanced Navigation Features

### 1. **Search and Discovery**

- Filter by resource type, status, or tags
- Quick access to recently used items
- Intelligent suggestions based on usage patterns

### 2. **Resource Management**
- Switch between projects and resources
- Access shared resources across projects
- Manage permissions and access controls
- Monitor resource usage and costs

### 3. **Integration Points**
- Direct links to Azure portal for advanced configuration
- Integration with Azure DevOps and GitHub
- Connection to Microsoft 365 and Power Platform
- Access to Azure ML Studio for hub-based projects

## Navigation Workflows
